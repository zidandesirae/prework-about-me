      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Being bored and ready to retire from my current job is not what I was thinking my life to be like at 25. I am in need of a complete change that will challenge my mind and push me to want to continue to learn more and more everyday. I believe being part of this Coding Boot Camp will do the trick!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Petaluma, California, a city located in Sonoma County which is part of the North Bay sub-region of the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies include trying new resturants, hiking, watching television and spending time friends and family.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Crazy enough, I dont have an exact answer for this question. I feel that once I find my passion I will find my dream job.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Arcadia in East Phoenix. I have lived in Phoenix for over 3 years now after moving from Tucson where I lived for 4 years.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am very interested in exploring a new career path where I can learn something new and challenging. </p>
